# Royston-Crow-Assignment-Tracker

A simple angular based web app for a small town newspaper editor to keep track of
reporters and categorize them under assignments. This was doen as an assesment of one
week of Angular training at the Epicodus coding school. Barely completed the
assignment in time, which is my only excuse for this poor README :-)
